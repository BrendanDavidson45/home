## Welcome to my personal site!

![Profile Picture](content/img/ProfilePic-2(1)(1).jpg)
  
I am a PhD Candidate of Political Science at Colorado State University and Intern with the Center for New Energy Economy. 
By training I specialize in International Relations, Comparative Politics, and Environmental Politics. My research covers environmental labor studies, the political ecology of labor, global political economy, and science and technology studies. Mosst of these center on green technologies, the energy transition, and the labor movement in the US and Nordic contexts. These themes are covered in peer reviewed articles written for [_Energy Research and Social Science_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629622004315), _Economic Labour Relations Review_ (forthcoming), and the _Labor Employment Relations Association_ (forthcoming).  

Previously, I was a Global Future of Work(ers) Fellow at Rutgers University (2021-2023), a fellow with Colorado State University's Vice President of Research Office (2022-2023). I received my MA in Environmental Policy and Public Administration from the University of Colorado, Denver in 2014, and my BA in Geography and Philosophy from the University of Northern Colorado in 2012.
