Fry, we have a crate to deliver. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Why did you bring us here?

We're rescuing ya. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

Bender, quit destroying the universe! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! I just told you! You've killed me! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?
