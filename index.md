## Welcome to my personal site!

![Profile Picture](content/img/ProfilePic-2(1)(1).jpg)
  
I am a PhD Candidate of Political Science at Colorado State University and Intern with the Center for New Energy Economy. 
By training I specialize in Environmental Politics, International Relations, and Comparative Politics. My research interests and specialities cover environmental labor studies, the political ecology of labor, global political economy, science and technology studies, and political geography. My current research agenda focuses work and labour associated with alternative energy technologies in the energy transition, primarily doing so in US and Nordic contexts. These themes are covered in peer reviewed articles written for [_Energy Research and Social Science_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629622004315), _Economic Labour Relations Review_ (forthcoming), and the _Labor Employment Relations Association_ (forthcoming).  

Previously, I was a Global Future of Work(ers) Fellow at Rutgers University (2021-2023), a fellow with Colorado State University's Vice President of Research Office (2022-2023). I received my MA in Environmental Policy and Public Administration from the University of Colorado, Denver in 2014, and my BA in Geography and Philosophy from the University of Northern Colorado in 2012.

Prior to pursuing a PhD, I also worked for several organizations and agencies like Colorado's Office for Victims Programs with the Department of Public Safety, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and National Park Service. 

When I'm not working, I can be found outside hiking, running, or fly-fishing.
